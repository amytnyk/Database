In this project, a study of Self-Balancing Binary Search Trees data structures was performed.  
Binary search trees are trees that are able to maintain a balance of their height, which significantly speeds up operations.  

The following Self-Balancing Binary Search Trees have been implemented:
- AVL tree
- B-tree
- Red-black tree
- Splay tree
- 2-3 tree
